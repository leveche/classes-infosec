#+title: Enterprise Linux Security Administration
*** Security Concepts
- Minimization
  - every installed component is a security risk, no such thing as
    innocuous service
    - every running component doubly so
      - services are no longer configured to start on boot by install
        scripts
  - discovery
    - packaged software
      - =rpm -qa=: all packages installed on system
      - =rpm -qi pkg=: info about package =pkg=
      - =rpm -ql pkg=: all files provided in package
      - =rpm -qf file=: which package provided the file
      - =rpm -qlp pkg.rpm=
      - lab (~5 mins)
        - objectives
          - use =rpm= do discover what packages are installed
          - trace dependency chain
        - tasks
          - list all packages installed
          - how many are there?
          - which package does =/usr/bin/openssl= belong to?
          - what packages require that package as dependencies?
          - now remove the packages in question
          - is this it?
            - =rpm -q --whatrequires $(rpm -q --provides openssl) | sort -u=
          - are we done now?
            - what do the packages we removed provide, and what
              depends on *that*?
    - unpackaged software
      - =find /where -user userid -exec rm {} \;=
      - =-ok= is like =-exec= but asks first
    - running processes
      - =chkconfig=
      - =netstat -taupe=
      - =ss -taupe=
      - =ps auxw=
      - =lsof -i=
      - lab (~5 minutes)
        - objectives
          - identify running processes
          - disable and uninstall unneeded software
        - tasks
          - which processes are configured to start at boot?
          - disable =avahi=, =bluetooth=, =xinetd= from starting on boot
          - what is listening on network?
            - =ss -taupe | grep LISTEN=
            - =lsof -i=
          - remove =xinetd= from the system
            - =rpm -e=
- Hardening
  - Already need a picture of who is going to access the service and
    what level of access they need
  - Do not trust default config!
  - Simplify!
  - packet filtering
    - pre-firewalld
      - config persists in =/etc/sysconfig/ip{,6}tables=
    - firewalld
  - service wrapping
    - =xinetd=
  - Authentication
    - PAM
      - shortcomings of PAM
  - minimizing service capabilities
    - least-privilege principle
    - =setuid=
    - POSIX 1003.1e capabilities
      - =capability.h=
      - =libcap=
        - =sucap=, =execcap=, =getpcaps=, =setpcaps=
      - lab 10 minutes
        - objectives
          - examine use of =capset()= and =setuid()= system calls
        - tasks
          - make sure =ntpd= is installed and running
          - what are the real and effective credentials of the =ntpd= process?
            - =ps -C ntpd -o comm,pid,ruser,euser,rgroup,egroup=
            - how does user =ntp= bind to port =tcp 123=, and how can
              it change system clock?
          - restart =ntpd= with tracing:
            - =strace -f ntpd -u ntp:ntp -g 2> ntp-calls &=
            - =grep -n bind ntp-calls | grep AF_INET=
            - =grep -n -B 5 capset ntp-calls=
              - which capabilities does it retain?
              - how does it change its effective user & group?
            - =grep -e [UG]id -e ^Cap /proc/$(pgrep ntpd)/status=
              - look for =Uid, Gid, Cap{Inh,Prm,Eff}=
    - =chroot=
      - lab 10 minutes
        - objectives
          - examine security implications of =chroot()=
        - tasks
          - install =busibox=
          - copy busibox and bash to =/tmp/jail=
          - =ldd *=, copy libraries to =/tmp/jail/lib=
          - =chroot /tmp/jail/bash=
          - =ls= does not exist!
          - use commands provided by =busybox=
          - from outside the jail, run =ls -la /proc/$(pgrep -xf /bash)/{cdw,root}=
      - SELinux is better!
        - no need to maintain multiple copies of software
*** Kerberos
**** Concepts and Components
- 'crustacean' model of network security: fortify the perimeter and
  trust the internal network
- RFC 1510
- central trusted server, KDC, that authenticates and issues tickets
- authentication only, authorization is up to the service
- principals:
  - name, e.g. =user/admin@EXAMPLE.ORG=, has 3 components:
    - primary: =user=. For services, indicates service type,
      e.g. =host/= or =ldap/=
    - instance: mandatory for service principals. For users, usually
      used to modify capabilities given to the principal
    - realm: =EXAMPLE.ORG=
- session replay protection
  - each ticket carries a sequence number
  - sequence numbers do no roll over in the validity window, usually 5
    mins
- Kerberos Components
  - Authentication Server (AS)
  - Ticket-Granting Servier (TGS)
  - kerberized services using KDC
- GSSAPI
- SASL
**** Authentication Process
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file tmp/krb5_auth_process.png :cache yes
@startuml
"Client Workstation" --> "Authentication Server": obtain tgt
"Authentication Server" --> "Client Workstation": obtain sgt for service 1
"Client Workstation" --> "Kerberized Service 1": use sgt for service 1
"Client Workstation" --> "Authentication Server": obtain sgt for service 2
"Client Workstation" --> "Kerberized Service 2": use sgt for service 2
@enduml
#+END_SRC
**** ticket attributes
- kerberos version + realm, unencrypted
- principal of the service, unencrypted
- principal of the user, unencrypted
- IP address of client host
- issued timestamp
- expiry timestamp
- session key to encrypt communication between client and service
**** Authenticators
encrypted with tgt, opague for the client
contains
- Client's principal
- hash of the ticket

- sequence number to prevent replay attacks
**** logging in
- obtain TGT. Optionally, AS can be set to require a pre-authenticator with the tgt request

**** administering and using kerberos
***** configuring master KDC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE /etc/kdc.conf
[kdcdefaults]
kdc_ports = 88
kdc_tcp_ports = 88

[realms]
EXAMPLE.COM = {
  acl_file     = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
  dict_file    = /usr/share/dict/words
  admin_keytab = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab
  supported_enctypes = aes256-cts:normal
}
#+END_EXAMPLE
***** KDC logging

Three types of data to be logged:
- default
- kdc: KDC logs
- admin_server

five possible destinations:
- FILE:filename: log to file
- STDERR: log to standard error
- CONSOLE: log to system console
- DEVICE=devicename: log to specified device
- SYSLOG:[severity:facility]: log to syslog

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE /etc/krb5.conf
[logging]
kdc=CONSOLE
kdc=SYSLOG:NOTICE:DAEMON
admin_server=FILE:/var/log/kadmin.log
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** KDC realm defaults

- libdefaults: defaults for all krb libraries
- appdefaults: defaults for specific client apps
- realms: realms used by client
- domain_realm: map DNS domain names -> realm names
- logging: kerb client logging
- capaths: x-realm authentications

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[libdefaults]
default_realm = EXAMPLE.COM
dns_lookup_realm = false
dns_lookup_kdc   = false
ticket_lifetime  = 24h
renew_lifetime   = 7d
forwardable      = yes
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[realms]
EXAMPLE.COM = {
  kdc = server1.example.com
  kdc = server2.example.com
  admin_server = server1.example.com
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** DNS autoconfig
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ORIGIN example.com

_kerberos              TXT   "EXAMPLE.COM"
_kerberos._udp         SRV   0 0 88 server1.example.com
                       SRV   0 0 88 server2.example.com
_kerberos-master._udp  SRV   0 0 99 server1.example.com
_kerberos-adm._tcp     SRV   0 0 749 server1.example.com
_kpasswd._udp          SRV   0 0 464 server1.example.com
#+END_EXAMPLE
***** keytabs
- keytab for =kadmind= on RHEL is in =/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5/keytab=
- fetch keys and save in keytabs with MIT kerberos: =kadmin=
  - =getprinc=, =list_principals=, etc
- read and modify local keytabs: =ktutil=
***** ticket types
- initial: issued directly to principal. non-initial are granted on
  the basis of another ticket
- forwardable
- proxiable: used by services to authenticate on behalf of principals
- renewable
- postdatable: validity of tickets starts in the future. used e.g. by
  cronjobs
- invalid: used e.g. by postdated tickets before they are valid
***** managing principals
attributes
| allow_forwardable |
| allow_postdated   |
| allow_proxiable   |
| requires_preauth  |
| requires_hwauth   |
| allow_svr         |
| allow_tix         |
| needschange       |
***** principal policies
- maxlife
- minlife
- minlife
- minlength
- minclasses
- history
***** securing workstation login
use =*K*= in =/etc/shadow= to indicate the principal should
authenticate via kerberos. e.g. =useradd -p "*K*" user=

on RHEL6, the pam config bypasses obtaining kerberos ticket if unix
password is set:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE pam_config
auth sufficient pam_unix.so try_first_pass
auth sufficient pam_krb5.so use_first_pass

- =ksu= command:
  - =~/.k5login= lists principals allowed to log in as that user
  - "kerberized sudo": =~/.k5users= specifies which kerberos principal is allowed to execute specific commands
#+END_EXAMPLE
***** forwarding kerberos tickets
- non-forwardable TGT =kinit -F=
- =telnet -x= to have telnet try to use krb5. it's the default with
  newer versions onf telnet
- =telnet -xF= will forward local credentials to the remote system
***** securing ssh with kerberos
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes

Host *
  GSSAPIAuthentication yes
#+END_EXAMPLE

- =kinit -f=
- ssh and transfer forwardable credentials: =ssh -o GSSAPIDelegatecredentials=yes targetserver=
- logout from ssh: =~.=
